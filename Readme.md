Analysis:
---------

All the code for the loading and transforming the data (complete with helpful comments) can be found in `run_analysis.R`. It produces `activity_tidy.txt` as described in the assignment as long as the `getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip` is in the working directory.

Codebook:
---------

The code book describing each variable and the transformations taken to get to the output can be found in `Codebook.md`.
